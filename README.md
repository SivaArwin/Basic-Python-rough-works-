# Basic-Python-rough-works-
Learning Python basics is a piece of cake, it is extremely simple to get up and running with Python. Basics like variables, operators and control structures are extremely easy to learn as opposed to other languages like Java.Its been 15 days that I have started Python learning so I feel that I am eligible to answer this question , I am person who doesn't have any prior programming experience. But my job profile pushing me to learn Python and that's it, I have browse internet and I got so many sources free as well as paid but I was confused which source should I follow whether youtube, or some website , but finally I got one PDF which has 250 pages , it's very good I will not say it's great but for starting point it's very good, to know the Python's fundamental, once you complete this 250 pages then you can move to the other sources by the time you will have more clarity in Python . If you need I may send you this to your mail id.
